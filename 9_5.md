## Important Tasks List
1. Prepare for the Mathematical Model Competition.
2. Learn some mathematical algorithms: find the greatest common divisor and calculate the number of prime numbers in a given range.
3. Learn the application of Boolean algebra, including finding the largest and smallest terms.

## Mathematical Model Competition
It is somewhat challenging to create an accurate model using only mathematics and physics. Perhaps we should also consider seeking assistance from GPT-4, a powerful tool at our disposal.
I am feeling a bit nervous about the meeting with Dr. Chen tomorrow, but I hope we can achieve success in our communication.
